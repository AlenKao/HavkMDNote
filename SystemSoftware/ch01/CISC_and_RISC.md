# CISC and RSIC

## CISC ([複雜指令集架構](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E8%A4%87%E9%9B%9C%E6%8C%87%E4%BB%A4%E9%9B%86%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6))

- **CISC: Complex Instruction Set Computers**
- Implementation of such an architecture in **hardware tends to be complex**.

## RISC Machines
- **RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer**
- This **simplified design** can result in
    -  faster and less expensive processor development
    -  greater reliability
    -  faster instruction fetching, decoding, and execution times.
- In general, a RISC system is characterized by 
    - a standard, **fixed instruction length** 
        - usually equal to **one machine word**
    - **single-cycle execution of most instructions**.
- Memory access is usually done by **load** and **store** instructions only.
- All instructions except for load and store are **register-to-register operations**.
- There are typically a relatively **large number of general-purpose registers**.
- The number of machine instructions, instruction formats, and addressing modes is relatively small.
